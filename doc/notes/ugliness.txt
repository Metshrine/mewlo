Sites use a prepare statement to walk hierarchy of objects -- not sure if this is avoidable/ideal.

we now have a set of prepare functions and then a startup() and shutdown() set of functions.

prepare and startup seem nearly identical in purpose -- should we merge them?

the only case that can be made to not do this would be to say that the prepare() code loads and creates  all dynamic objects, etc,
while the startup() calls can let objects inquire about each other, knowing that they all have been loaded.

but perhaps it makes more sense to think of these as two phases inside the startup() code,
i.e. that prepare() is something we do inside startup()

we have objects called MewloPackages -- might be too confusing with python term of "packages"
can we rename it to something similar like "packs"?

i'd like to standardize all startup and shutdown functions to take an eventlist and report issues.
and create debug log entries with startup reports.
