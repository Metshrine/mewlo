I'm not happy about how the way we send messages to the logging system, and the need to carry around the site and request.
And the way that events (EDebug, EWarning) are created via macro-like function.
See Event class.

The Event class itself is not bad per se -- it's more how we invoke the proper logger.

There is some ugly stuff involving references to parents in get_parent and get_site called (see loggers).

Sites use a prepare statement to walk hierarchy of objects -- not sure if this is avoidable/ideal.
