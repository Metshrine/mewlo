Routemanager (and log system) uses the startup function to walk a hierarchy of objects and set parenting hierarchy info; this is done so that we can track the hierarchy no matter what order the objects are created.
Is there a better way to do this?

we have objects called MewloPackages -- might be too confusing with python term of "packages"
can we rename it to something similar like "packs"?

i'd like to standardize all startup and shutdown functions to take an eventlist and report issues.
and create debug log entries with startup reports.

alternatively, rethink how we are treating these startup events specially, and ask if we really want to do that, or if we shouldnt let them use normal logging for errors
