split larger module files with multiple classes (site, etc.)

right now we have a single global signal dispatcher.
receivers register for messages with it, and can set filters on what they get signaled about
but with huge numbers of signals this might be a lot of checking
should we instead have receivers attach to specific sender slots?

it's possible that we could emulate the efficiency of this using a hash system in the single global dispatcher
