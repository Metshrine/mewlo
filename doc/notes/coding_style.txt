This file documents coding style guidelines used in Mewlo project
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------



1. See:
See documentation_style.txt file for info on documentation style
See error_handling.txt file for guidelines on error handling




2. The top of each code file should look like (leave out import sections that are not used):
"""
filename.py
Description of file.
"""


# mewlo imports
imports of mewlo core files

# helper imports
helper file imports

# 3rd party lib imports
3rd party lib imports

# python imports
built in python library imports



3.
Mewlo code should conform to the official PEP8 style guide: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008
(even though I personally dislike some of the choices it makes).


4.
Prefer long named functions, properties, classes.
Mewlo classes typically have a prefix of M or Mewlo.



5.
ALL filenames should be in lowercase using underscores to separate words.
