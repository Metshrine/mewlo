Python egg and setuptools have a way of supporting plugins via "entry points"
We need to think about whether we want to use this for our plugin system, or how to combine our plugin mechanism with it.
See http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pylons-webframework/en/latest/advanced_pylons/entry_points_and_plugins.html

See http://aroberge.blogspot.com/2008/12/plugins-part-6-setuptools-based.html
See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/774824/explain-python-entry-points
At the least we need to support the syntax used for python egg entry points in our controller callables lookup, which is already quite similar.
