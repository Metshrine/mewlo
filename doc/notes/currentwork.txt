Decide how to handle startup messages vs log messages.

This is an odd one.
In the current code, when we startup and validate a site, the startup functions RETURN a list of events/messages.
We check this code for any errors or warnings, and optionally display them.
That is, errors at validation/startup time are returned and not sent to log.
But a question arises, should we be logging these message in addition (or instead)?
One problem with trying to log them is that by their nature they may occur early before log system is setup.
A problem with not logging them as they are encountered is that a crashing error would not have any info in log file.

Some ideas:

1. have the log system be the very FIRST thing that is set up, with a catchall file logger that is the first thing setup and checked, and a hard exit with message if it fails to set up properly
have this catch all serious startup errors -- maybe even have this file be a special one which overwrites on each run. 

2. explicitly log startup (debug) messages

3. return warnings and errors from startup procedure as before

Change all print statements in testing to some generic log/output function.

Landmark 1:
Proper debug logging
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------


//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Idea:

Have a fallback file logger that is always set up.
when debugging is enabled, ALL messages log to that file, regardless of where else it is logged.
when debugging is disabled, NOTHING gets logged to that file.
