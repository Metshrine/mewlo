This file documents coding style guidelines used in Mewlo project
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------



1. See:
See DocumentationStyle.txt file for info on documentation style
See ErrorHandling.txt file for guidelines on error handling




2. The top of each code file should look like (leave out import sections that are not used):
"""
FILENAME.py
Description of file.
"""


# mewlo imports
imports of mewlo core files

# helper imports
helper file imports

# 3rd party lib imports
3rd party lib imports

# python imports
built in python library imports



3.
Mewlo code should conform to the official PEP8 style guide: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008
(even though I personally dislike some of the choices it makes).


4.
Prefer long named functions, properties, classes.
Mewlo classes typically have a prefix of M or Mewlo.
