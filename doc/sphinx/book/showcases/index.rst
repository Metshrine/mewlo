Showcase Sites
==============

Self-teaching School:

    * The idea for this is based on the self-teaching programming school I set up around 2003, but generalized for multiple subjects, and set up so it can be community-run.
    * What we want is to be a player in the online education market, but focused on helping "guilds" create guided self-teaching "courses" that users can follow to teach themselves, and to aid groups in organizing curated links and media to help users teach (and evaluate) themselves.
    * Also needs to include facilities to help guild experts to advise/grade users, serving loosely as teachers.
    * It should include lots of support for motivational features that help encourage self-learning students to progress (badges, awards, ladders of assignments, certificates, etc.).
    * Might also include a job-board type thing where we could help students get jobs by connecting them with potential employers, or helping them create cv pages, etc.


Programmer's Guild (aka DC3):

    * The idea of this site is to be a much more scalable and open-to-all site where programmers can create pages/projects/guilds to collaborate on projects, solicit donations, provide forum-based support for their projects.
    * The focus is on the idea of guilds -- self managed small groups of coders, whose products and members are presented in a standard way that makes it easy for visitors to learn about.
    * Perhaps with a focus on end-user funding (donations) and easing the process for commercial licensees/funders.
    * We would expect things like groups (guilds), micro-forums for each project, author, user/guild/project pages, etc.


Review/Recommendation Site:

    * Hierarchical editors manage content
    * Living-reviews (ie always kept up-to-date) based on an editor-approved public-suggestion wiki system.
    * Flexible filtering, searching, sorting, comparison tables.
    * Recommendation system support.
