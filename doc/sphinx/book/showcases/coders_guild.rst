Programmer's Guild (DC3)
============================


    * The idea of this site is to be a much more scalable and open-to-all site where programmers can create pages/projects/guilds to collaborate on projects, solicit donations, provide forum-based support for their projects.
    * The focus is on the idea of guilds -- self managed small groups of coders, whose products and members are presented in a standard way that makes it easy for visitors to learn about.
    * Perhaps with a focus on end-user funding (donations) and easing the process for commercial licensees/funders.
    * We would expect things like groups (guilds), micro-forums for each project, author, user/guild/project pages, etc.
