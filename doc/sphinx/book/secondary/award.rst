Awards and Badges
=================


Sites frequently want to give out awards and badges that are shown for users -- to celebrate their accomplishments.

Some features of awards and badges:

   * Different badges/awards have different rules about who can award them.
   * We frequently want pages showing who has which awards.
   * We need different views of badges/awards at different sizes.
   * Some badges may be user-selectable (BGG let's users BUY badges).
