Console Tool
============


Many web frameworks (and even some CMS, e.g. Drupal) include a console/commandline tool/scripting system that let's an administrator perform administrative actions via a commandline interface.

For example Django provides functionality and documentation for administrator to create and manage objects directly from python interpreter.
