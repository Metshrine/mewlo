Digest System
=============


The Digest System is somewhat related to the Throttling System.

It is designed to collect periodic event information over time and then generate an occasional "report" (typically via email).
The frequency and format of such reports might be adjustable by each user to control what reports get sent at what frequency and with what detail.

So for example, a user might ask to get a daily digest summarizing replies posted to their topics.
