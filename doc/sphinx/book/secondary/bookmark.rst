Bookmarks and Tags
==================


Bookmarks and Tags (and also ratings) are related in that they are ways that users can track their own reactions to content.

Bookmarks are always private.  Tags are usually private but common use of tags may be used by the system.  Ratings are usually part of public stats.

Do we really need both tags and bookmarks, or can tags easily be used as bookmarks?  Let's just use tags.

Tags are stored in a table with records associating [UserId,TagId,ObjectId]
