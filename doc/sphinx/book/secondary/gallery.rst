Image Gallery
================


There are many places where we want to be able to collect groups of images and support their use:

   * When we want to allow a user to select an avatar images from a hierarchical collection of thousands.
   * When we want to allow an editor to select a piece of clipart to associate with a blog post.
   * When we want to allow forum posters to add smileys to their messages.

The Image Collection module supports these kinds of functions as well as backend management of image collections.


We might also use the Image Collection system for hierarchical user-curated image galleries.
