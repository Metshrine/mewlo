Search System
=============


This is a topic that needs much more thought.

   * Obviously every site wants to help users search for content on the site.  There are several things we want to think about:
   * We want to make it easy to use 3rd party web search (google), but have a complete internal search system that doesn't depend on it.
   * We would like a flexible search/filter/sort system for full-text searching of data on the website.
