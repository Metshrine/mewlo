Forum
=====


We want a full fledged first class forum system as part of Mewlo, that will rival the best forum systems out there.

One difference from normal forums is that we need to support huge numbers of forum sections that are somewhat isolated from one another.  You can see this at work on the Board Game Geek site, where each product has it's own forum area and the idea of linked forums, etc.

Main models:

   * Sections - hierarchical organization of sections/categories
   * Topics - Topics and threads contain posts.
   * Posts - The actual post messages.
