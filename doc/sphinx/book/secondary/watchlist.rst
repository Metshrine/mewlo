Watchlist
=========


The Watchlist system is designed to make it easier for administrators to detect and track malicious or spammy behavior, by allowing administrators to set up (or automatically set up based on certain triggers) filters that track users or events and let an administrator configure how to report such information.

Some examples:

   * New users may be automatically added to a Watchlist for 1 week or until they have made 5 posts -- any content or messages they attempt to send before then will be relayed to administrator.


Ideally it would be nice to let the Watchlist and Spam system indicate that some content be put on a waitlist until approval, or that it undergo an additional human-test.

A generic system for holding/waitlisting content would be very useful.
