Spam Checker
============


The Spam Checker system provides a support API that other Mewlo code to get advice about the likelyhood that some information (email, content, comment, IP) is spam.
As a centralized place for spam checking it can also provide useful stats and logging events to help track down spammers.

See also the Watchlist system.

Ideally it would be nice to let the Watchlist and Spam system indicate that some content be put on a waitlist until approval, or that it undergo an additional human-test.
