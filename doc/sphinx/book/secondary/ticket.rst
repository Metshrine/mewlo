Ticket System
=============


There are three main uses of a ticket system on a Mewlo website:

   * The first is use of tickets among private administrators of the site to help track items.  This is a way for administrators to keep track of bugs and tasks and avoid stepping on each other's toes and communicating with one another.
   * The second use is in providing a support ticket system for use among users, on a per-project basis. In this scenario groups will manage their own support ticket categories.
   * The third use is in letting visitors submit tickets to website moderators for issues they are having on the site.

The ticket system can also serve as the mechanism by which people "report" posted content that is inappropriate.
