Advert System
=============


One often wants to show advertisements on pages.

We would like a flexible Mewlo provided advertisement system with the following features:

   * Pages suggest where (and what size) ads might be places, and WHO should split/get revenue from such ads, and keywords for filtering the kinds of ads to display.
   * There may be times when we want to use Google ads, or ads from other external services, configuring to give revenue to who it should.
   * We will often want admin control for certain visitors, globally, or for certain pages, to disable ads completely, or replace them with some INTERNAL things like quote boxes, internal ads, etc.
   * We want an internal ad system that will let advertisers bid to have their advertisements shown locally -- that is we want our own advertisement system that doesn't involve 3rd party service.
   * We want a user quotes/testimonial system that we can use for our internal ads.
   * We want a rotating random internal-advert system (ie screenshots of other software pages on the site).
