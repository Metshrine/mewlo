Introduction to Secondary Packages
==================================


This section describes "secondary packages" in Mewlo.

We could view these as "addons" that could be coded by 3rd party developers, and designed as OPTIONAL modules.

However, some of them may get moved into core (Form, Javascript, etc.).

These are good candidates for other coders to pick and work on as their own projects.
