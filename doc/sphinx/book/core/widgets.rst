GUI Widgets
===========


Cms/Blog systems frequently make use of "widgets" -- some modular chunk of code and text that can be displayed on pages and reused in different scenarios.

Some "Widgets" that Mewlo provides in core:

    * Wysiwyg editor (we will not reimplement this but use something existing)
    * Robust administration table (with filtering, sorting, bulk checkbox operations, row operations).
    * Login/Registration boxes
    * Newsletter signup boxes
