File Uploads
============


There are lots of occasions where a web service will want to allow people to upload and manage files/images.

Mewlo includes robust support for such things:

    Nice organization of uploaded files (don't just dump a million files in one directory).
    Functions for tracking stats on files, alerting on suspicious behavior.
    Antivirus scanning.
    Protection of files from public linking or non-user downloads, if desired; or placement in public folders to reduce noon-static resource serving cpu usage.
    Cleanup and maintenance and error checking administration backend.
    Support for automatic thumbnailing, caching, web grabbing from external sites.
