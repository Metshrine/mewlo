Navigation Structure and Menu
=============================


Most sites have a hierarchical organizational structure, which some form of menu(s) to help visitors navigate the site, and tell them where they are (via highlighting current page in menu, showing breakcrumbs, etc.).

"Menus" can take the form of horizontal main menus at top of the page, or vertical sidebars.

Mewlo supports a hierarchical site organization model where each node can be annotated with information to support rendering menus, page titles and headings, and breadcrumbs.
