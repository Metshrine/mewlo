Avatars are associated with Users but may also be used for groups or projects.

Some features of the Mewlo Avatar system:

    Because Avatars may be shown very frequently, they will usually be hosted as static files that can be served by a static-efficient web server.
    Avatars may be user uploads, or grabbed from a foreign website.
    Avatars may also be generated (and cached or linked to) from one of many avatar services (Gravatar, etc.).
    Avatars may be scaled and cached in multiple sized for different purposes.
