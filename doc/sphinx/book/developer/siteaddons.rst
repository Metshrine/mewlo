Site Addons
===========

Django has the concept of an "App" which is a moduler, reusable, self-contained set of files that implement some controller routes, views, and configuration information.
Think of an "App" like a self-contained add-on which can handle certain requests (usually matching a url prefix).

The reusable and modular nature of such bundles is what makes them appealing.

Mewlo supports such a concept.  The term "app" is misleading but i don't have a much better term at this point, so i'm just refering to them as "site addons".
