Use Cases
=========


Some non-obvious but important use cases:

Pages where moderators (or users) can manage a huge table of data:

    * nice pagination
    * complex column display
    * complex column filtering
    * action on rows
    * checkboxes for bulk actions
    * two-table combos of dense row and report view (like smf mailbox)
    * use of get variables for pagination and filtering combined with url routing


Diverting user to login/registration page before continuing on to destination; sometimes just to confirm password for security.

Forcing user to acknowledge message or change password before continuing.

Automatically creating (and modifying?) database tables from column definitions in models.

Upgrading addon (or core) modules which need to MODIFY database structures.

Managing older version histories of data objects and rolling back.

Checking content posts for spam.
