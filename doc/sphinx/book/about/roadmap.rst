Mewlo Roadmap
=============


Implementation progress:

   * Main Site and SiteManager classes - 90% done
   * Logging system - 75% done
   * URL Routing system - 75% done
   * Configuration system - 75% done
   * Documentation system and guidelines - 90% done
   * Package/plugin/addon system - 75% done


What's next to work on?


Figure out how a registration/login system could be added as a package-like thing,
but with user being able to customize the views for custom sites.
