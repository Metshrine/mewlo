The Mewlo Web Framework
=======================

What is Mewlo?

 * Mewlo is an Open Source framework/library which allows coders to build custom community-based (user accounts, groups, projects, forum, etc.) web services.
 * The aim of Mewlo is to provide the absolute best implementation of the common infrastructure of code seen in so many community-based web services.
 * Mewlo supports robust user and group accounts, social-website features (user profiles, messaging, forums, etc.), and it offers strong support for community moderators to manage users and site content.  It is designed to perform well on large sites.
 * Note that Mewlo is a framework for coders, it's not a content management system for non-coders.  One should *NOT* expect to set up a Mewlo site without writing a single line of code, the way you would set up a content management system or blog.
